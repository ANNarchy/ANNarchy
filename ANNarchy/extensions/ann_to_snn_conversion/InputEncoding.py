#=====================================================ENCODING TECHNICHS =========================================================================
#
#	The Intrinsically Bursting and Chattering type of encoding has implemented by referring to the paper "Simple Model of Spiking Neurons"
#	by Eugene M. Izhikevich, this is achieved by manipulating the parameters of Izhikevich Neuron and the nature of the neuron activity
#	of the these two technichs are as of Burst Coding.
#
#	The Phase Coding Oscillation type of encoidng has implemented by referring ot the paper "Deep neural networks with weighted spikes"
#	by Jaehyun Kim et al., this is achieved by writing the equation of the phase(equation 6) of the referred paper and multiplying phase
#	with the thershold(vt being constant) value to set the new dynamic thershold.
