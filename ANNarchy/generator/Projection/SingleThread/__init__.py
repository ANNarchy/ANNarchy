"""
The SingleThread package does contain all code templates required for the single-thread
code generation in ANNarchy.

BaseTemplates:

    defines the basic defintions common to all sparse matrix formates, e. g. projection header

[FORMAT]_SingleThread:

    defines the format specific defintions for the currently available formats:

        * LIL: list-in-list
        * COO: coordinate
        * BSR: blocked compressed row
        * CSR: compressed sparse row
        * ELL: ELLPACK/ITPACK
        * ELL-R: ELLPACK with row-length array
        * HYB: hybrid format comprising of ELLPACK and coordinate
        * Dense: a full matrix representation

    there are some special purpose implementations:

        * CSR_T: compressed sparse row (transposed)
