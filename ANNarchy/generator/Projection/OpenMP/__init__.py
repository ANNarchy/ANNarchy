"""
The OpenMP package does contain all code templates required for the openMP
code generation in ANNarchy.

BaseTemplates:

    defines the basic defintions common to all sparse matrix formates, e. g. projection header

[FORMAT]_SingleThread:

    defines the format specific defintions for the currently available formats:

        * LIL: list-in-list
        * COO: coordinate
        * CSR: compressed sparse row
        * ELL: ELLPACK/ITPACK
        * ELL-R: ELLPACK format with row-length array
        * Dense: a full matrix representation

    there are some special purpose implementations:

        * CSR_T: compressed sparse row (transposed)
        * LIL_P: a partitioned LIL representation
