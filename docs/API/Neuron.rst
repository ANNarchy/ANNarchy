Neuron classes
**********************************

Neurons are container objects for all information corresponding to a special neuron type. This encapsulation allows a higher readability of the code. Through derivation of ``ANNarchy.Neuron`` the user can define the neuron types he needs in his model. ANNarchy provides two specialised classes for the definition of neurons of different modeling types: rate-coded and spiking neurons.

Class RateNeuron
================

.. autoclass:: ANNarchy.RateNeuron
    :members:


Class SpikeNeuron
