Documentation for ANNarchy
===========================

ANNarchy (Artificial Neural Networks architect) is a neural simulator designed for distributed rate-coded or spiking neural networks. The core of the library is written in C++ and distributed using openMP or CUDA. It provides an interface in Python for the definition of the networks. It is released under the `GNU GPL v2 or later <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html>`_.
