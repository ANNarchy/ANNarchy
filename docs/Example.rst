This section provides a step-by-step description of the sample models provided in the ANNarchy package in the ``examples/`` directory.

    * `Neural Fields <example/NeuralField.html>`_: In ``examples/neural_field`` is implemented a simple model using `neural field <http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Neural_fields>`_ recurrent networks. This is a very simple rate-coded model without learning.
    
    * `Bar Learning <example/BarLearn.html>`_: In ``examples/bar_learning`` is an implementation of the bar learning problem. It illustrates the implementation of learning in rate-coded networks.

    * `Izhikevich's pulsed network <example/Izhikevich.html>`_: In ``examples/izhikevich`` is an implementation of the simple pulsed network described in (Izhikevich, 2003). It is a simple spiking network without learning.
